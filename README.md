# GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow

This repository demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions to deploy a website to GitHub Pages.

## Features

- Automatically deploys the website to GitHub Pages on every push to the `main` branch.
- Includes a simple HTML file (`index.html`) saying "Hello, GitHub Actions!"

## How It Works

1. Push changes to the `main` branch.
2. GitHub Actions runs the workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
3. The workflow builds and deploys the site to GitHub Pages.
